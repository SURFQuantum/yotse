# This configuration file corresponds to the shortest path Delft-Eindhoven using SURFnet fiber data.
# The lengths [km] of the path segments are [14.6, 68.2, 19.1, 75.1, 49.5].
# To place one repeater and two midpoint stations, two segments must be combined into a single longer segment.
# Here, we have chosen to combine the segment of 14.6 with the one of 68.2, making the effective segments
# [82.8, 19.1, 75.1, 49.5].
# Corresponding are the losses [dB] [5.1, 16.7, 6.2, 16.6, 12.6], which become [21.8, 6.2, 16.6, 12.6].
# These correspond to attenuation coefficients [dB/km]: [0.263, 0.325, 0.221, 0.255].

# NOTE: The `bright_state_param` values in this file were chosen arbitrarily as an example. They may not result in the best possible performance.

# This configuration file is meant to be used as input to the nlblueprint/simulations/unified_simulation_script.py script
