QiaOpt

QiaOpt aims to enable computational experiments using QIA software (in particular Netsquid). The library provides a set of pre-define functions to perform parameters explorations and parameters optimizations in a scalable and efficient way. The tools are based on the QCG-Pilotjob project (https://qcg-pilotjob.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), a job manager that can be executed locally (laptops) or in HPC centers.
